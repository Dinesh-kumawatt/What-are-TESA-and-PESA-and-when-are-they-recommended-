# What-are-TESA-and-PESA-and-when-are-they-recommended-

TESA (Testicular Sperm Aspiration) and PESA (Percutaneous Epididymal Sperm Aspiration) are surgical sperm-retrieval techniques used when men have no sperm in the ejaculate (azoospermia) due to obstructive causes (e.g., vas deferens blockage) or non-obstructive causes where sperm production is limited. PESA retrieves sperm from the epididymis via a needle aspiration and is often used for obstructive azoospermia. TESA samples sperm directly from testicular tissue and can be used when epididymal sperm arenâ€™t available or in non-obstructive azoospermia. Retrieved sperm are typically used with ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) during IVF to fertilize eggs. These procedures are usually outpatient, performed under local or general anesthesia, and paired with counseling about sperm quality, possible need for repeat retrievals, and genetic testing where indicated. Your fertility team will decide the best approach based on diagnosis and semen/testicular evaluation.
